The Turkish Air Force (Turkish: TÃ¼rk Hava Kuvvetleri) is the aerial warfare service branch of the
Turkish Armed Forces.
The Turkish Air Force can trace its origins back to June 1911 when it was founded by the Ottoman Empire,
however, the air force as it is known today did not come into existence until 1923 with the creation of
the Republic of Turkey.[14] It is considered to be the third largest airforce in NATO.

In 1998, the Turkish Armed Forces announced a program of modernization worth US$160 billion over a twenty-year
period in various projects.[16] $45 billion was earmarked to go to the overhaul of the Turkish Air Force,
and includes commissioning new combat aircraft (consisting of multi-role and fifth generation stealth fighters)
and helicopters (consisting of heavy lift, attack, medium lift and light general purpose helicopters).

According to Flight International (Flightglobal.com) and the International Institute for Strategic Studies,
the Turkish Air Force has an active strength of 50,000 military personnel and operates approximately 1,248
manned aircraft (2020).
