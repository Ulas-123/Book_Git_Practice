Ankara, Turkey’s cosmopolitan capital, sits in the country’s central Anatolia region. 
It’s a center for the performing arts, home to the State Opera and Ballet, 
the Presidential Symphony Orchestra and several national theater companies. 
Overlooking the city is Anitkabir, 
the enormous hilltop mausoleum of Kemal Atatürk, modern Turkey’s first president,
who declared Ankara the capital in 1923.
